## I. Firefighting and property damage

### Overview

The National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) is both a data set and a
series of software systems built around collecting data on fires in the US
and analyzing it for many purposes (national initiative effectiveness, risk
management, etc).  It was established by the USFA (United States Fire Administration)
and is freely available to the public.  Many firefighting agencies in the United
States provide data on each incident they respond to into this national system.

I personally have worked with NFIRS before on the reporting side; as a firefighter
and later an officer in the Boone County Fire Protection District, all of the
reports I wrote and some of the ad-hoc software I implemented interfaced with
the ingestion end of the NFIRS database.  Some of the interesting information
available in it is a series of categorization fields for each incident
and the total resulting property damage.

This loss data is of particular interest because when prioritizing incidents
and when doing incident preplanning, having comparative predictions of actual
likely property loss for a given structure or residence and incident type
could be very valuable to a dispatch center, insurance agency, or first due fire
officer for a response area.

### Example Use Cases for a predictive property loss algorithm:

* During a large natural disaster when many fires are reported simultaneously in real time,
a dispatch agency may choose to prioritize response to incidents (or proactively increase
the default response level to a given incident) based upon predicted property damages.

* When performing a risk analysis, an insurance agent may wish to augment their
actuarial tables with predictive property loss for this particular structure
given a range of potential incidents, thus more finely calibrating the premium
to charge for a given range of coverage.

* Officers at a fire station often choose which structures in their runbox
to do detailed preplanning on based on perceived risk. Having predicted property
loss for a range of structures could help inform priority decisions for the
most important structures to perform detailed planning exercises for.

For this project I will be using just the NFIRS data from 2011 (which is
still a very large dataset), but in a production system this dataset would
benefit from being continually adjusted for inflation and augmented
in an ongoing manner with additional data from each year as data is added to
the NFIRS database.

- _Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?_
- _Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?_

### Intended Approach

For this project I will be taking the raw dbase files for the 2011
NFIRS data.  The dataset is very big (2.2 million basic records)
and we don't actually need all of it as some of those incidents
are not fires (Medical, hazmat, search and rescue, etc).

I intend to reduce the set of data under consideration to just
structural fire incidents, and extract/normalize just the features
that are relevant to predicting property loss.  Then I intend
to use the tensorflow framework to train a regression model
such that given a set of features for a target structure/incident,
we can make a reasonable prediction of likely real property loss.

*Possible Example Usecase:*
  A dispatch center receives a 911 call reporting a single-room fire
  inside a residential single-family dwelling at a given address.  
  That address is used by supporting software systems to query
  dimensions of the structure.  Questions from the dispatcher are used
  to establish what materials are on site and what the expected
  ignition source was, whether a fire detector has sounded, etc
  (standard questions currently asked in 911 calls during dispatch).  
  The data is fed into the model and produces an expected dollar value
  of $237,500.00 property loss from this incident.  Based on the
  unexpectedly high property loss estimate, a second alarm (
  extra fire trucks and personnel) are immediately dispatched rather
  than waiting for the first engine to arrive and size up the scene.

- _Is the problem statement clearly defined? Will the reader understand what you are expecting to solve?_
- _Have you thoroughly discussed how you will attempt to solve the problem?_
- _Is an anticipated solution clearly defined? Will the reader understand what results you are looking for?_

### Cost function and Validation

To train the algorithm, I'll be using Mean Squared Error as
the cost function and trying to minimize it to find the regression
of best fit.  In layman's terms, this is taking the sum of the
squared differences between each real y value and the predicted y value
for the current function, divided by the number of elements (the
average of the squared error in prediction).  This is formally
written as:

  ![MSE][https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/67b9ac7353c6a2710e35180238efe54faf4d9c15]

Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the metrics youâ€™ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?_
- _Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?_


## II. Analysis
_(approx. 2-4 pages)_

### Data Exploration

The NFIRS data arrives in a set of tables that can be joined together.
The "basicincident.dbf" file has fields that apply to all incidents,
and then there are other incident fields which are different per type
of incident being described (basicaid, arson, fireincident,
  hazmat, wildlands, etc).  For the purposes of this analysis, we're looking
at fire incidents and the property loss they cause, so we really only
need the basicincident.dbf file and the fireincident.dbf file.

There are over 2 million records in the basicincident file, but only about 600k
have a record in the fireincident table.  We'll further select out
those incidents which result in no damage (there are many) and
those that are not of a "fire" incident type (even in fire incidents, there
  are things like false alarms which are common), so our final
data set is actually closer to 200k records.

The target column we'll be looking at is "PROP_LOSS", which represents the
dollar value loss of property destroyed in a given emergency incident.  After
trimming outliers (there are several high-dollar value losses that really skew
  the data over all), here's what the distribution looks like:

| stat  | PROP_LOSS $ value |
| count |  196574.000000    |
| mean  |    8914.580748    |
| std   |   12933.652034    |
| min   |       1.000000    |
| 25%   |    1000.000000    |
| 50%   |    3000.000000    |
| 75%   |   10000.000000    |
| max   |   60000.000000    |

We can see that even after chopping off a lot of high value outliers, the data
skews heavily to the low end, with the median being $3000 even though the mean
damage is up at $8914.

After combing the fire and basic incident tables into one tabular dataset, there
are still > 130 columns to consider, many of which are not strongly related
to the output target (property loss).

Most of the fields are categorical (the type of building, the type of fire,
the type of ignition source, etc), but there are a few numeric fields
(number of firetrucks, number of response personnel, square feet of structure).

One of the challenges we have for the numeric fields is that there's plenty
of missing data.  For example, square feet.  All buildings on fire have
some square footage, but not all incident reports include it.  Out of nearly
200000 records 106645 have no square foot value included.  The rest are
distributed like this:

| field | SQ_FEET  |
| count |    87153 |
| mean  |    10291 |
| std   |   579840 |
| min   |        1 |
| 25%   |      800 |
| 50%   |     1200 |
| 75%   |     1944 |
| max   | 10000000 |

There are several fields like this, with high outliers and skewed distributions,
and a lot of missing data.  The plan for these numeric fields is to replace
missing values with the median value of the dataset to keep a lot of 0s and -1s
from throwing off the relationship, and trimming extreme outliers.

- _If a dataset is present for this problem, have you thoroughly discussed certain features about the dataset? Has a data sample been provided to the reader?_
- _If a dataset is present for this problem, are statistics about the dataset calculated and reported? Have any relevant results from this calculation been discussed?_
- _If a dataset is **not** present for this problem, has discussion been made about the input space or input data for your problem?_
- _Are there any abnormalities or characteristics about the input space or dataset that need to be addressed? (categorical variables, missing values, outliers, etc.)_

### Exploratory Visualization

One of the first things I wanted to look at was the distribution of the
target variable (the property loss value), because many of the values
tended low and I know for regression problems it's nice to have
a normal distribution.  Here's the distribution of the raw data:

![Property Loss](images/PropLossDistribution.png)

It skews to the right pretty significantly. I experimented with trying to
perform a regression on it with several learners, and when I compared
them to running the same regression exercise on the log of that
target variable the difference in r-squared scores was a full 0.1 for
nearly every learner in favor of the log version.  Here's
the same data run through a logarithmic transform first:

![Property Loss Log](images/PropLossLogDistribution.png)

- _Have you visualized a relevant characteristic or feature about the dataset or input data?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Algorithms and Techniques

My plan of attack was to spot check a series of regression learning
algorithms and pick a few that perform fairly well with naive parameters
to tune further.

The algorithm that performed above and beyond the other regressions
considered was Gradient Tree Boosting.  This is a process where
a sequence of weak learners are fit in sequence to try to get closer
and closer to the correct labels for given inputs.  The set of learners
are combined additively so that a prediction is really the sum of all
the weak trees in the model. The "gradient" portion is for gradient
descent, which in this case is by following a given loss function
and trying to minimize it with each step (I use "least squares" in
this project).

This algorithm has several hyperparameters that I tuned:

*loss function*: Although I chose to use least squares, it's also
possible to use absolute error or a couple other options that are more
resiliant to outliers.  In this case I removed the significant
outliers from the dataset up front, and my exhaustive grid search
yielded the best results with least squares.

*learning_rate*: this represents how much one trusts the change of
each additional weak learner.  However, since I tuned with the
n_estimators parameter I didn't mess with this much (a lower learning rate
with more learners should behave similarly to a higher learning rate
with fewer learners).

*n_estimators*: This is just the number of boosting steps to go
through, could also be though of as the number of weak learners used
in sequence.

*max_depth*: how deep any given weak learner can go, which can
help avoid overfitting.

*min_samples_split*: how big a leaf in a given tree is allowed to be.

For initial training I just used a series of default parameters to see
how the model did out of the box, then during tuning I built a grid of
possible parameter combinations and ran them exhaustively through all
combinations to see which combination yielded the best performing learner.

- _Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?_
- _Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?_
- _Is it made clear how the input data or datasets will be handled by the algorithms and techniques chosen?_

### Benchmark

I used a random dummy regression to produce a baseline set of scoring
metrics in order to make sure that any results I obtained were
signficant.  When run over the training set of data and then predicting
against the test set, the Dummy learner performed as follows:

```
Mean Absolute Error:   1.56
Mean Squared Error:    4.44
Median Absolute Error: 1.39
R - Squared:          -3.33
```

remember, those are errors off of the log of the property damage target.
I then also checked the performance of a naive linear regression just
to have a sense of how much better a given approach would do compared
to the results of a fairly simply out-of-the-box algorithm using the
same approach as the dummy (train against the training set, score
  against the test set):

```
Mean Absolute Error:   1.22
Mean Squared Error:    2.90
Median Absolute Error: 0.94
R - Squared:           0.35
```

The results here are covered in detail in the AlgorithmExploration
notebook.

- _Has some result or value been provided that acts as a benchmark for measuring performance?_
- _Is it clear how this result or value was obtained (whether by data or by hypothesis)?_


## III. Methodology
_(approx. 3-5 pages)_

### Data Preprocessing

The first step I went through was transforming the DBF files
into a format I could work with more easily (sqlite), which just
involved doing a one-to-one transformation of the tables I cared
about (2 out of something like 12 tables) from the DBF files to records in a sqlite database. See the
script at "bin/data_to_sqlite" for this transformation.

Step 2 was to take to join together the Fire incidents and Basic
incidents tables together into a single tabular row per datapoint
for easier fitting to the sklearn models later. The raw data is
structured such that a single incident might have data about it
denormalized across many tables, but what I cared about for this
process was the data in the "Fire incidents" table, and it's
accompanying  information in the "Basic Incidents" table.  
Joining them was a simple matter of iterating through all records
in the fire table, finding the accompanying record in the basic
table, and joining them together into a single record in the
output database for that step.  This is done in the script
located at "bin/join_incidents_to_one_table"

The NFIRS dataset has a lot of dimensions available.  Since I only
really have 200k data points to use, I didn't want to include everything
because I was concerned about the curse of dimensionality.  Due to this,
the first major preprocessing step I took was Feature Selection.  I took
each feature that I though might be relevant and tried to plot it against
the target variable (Property Value Loss) to see if it showed a
relationship.  The "FeatureExploration" notebook contains this work.

As a result of this visualization exercise, I selected the following inputs
which seemed to show relevant relationships:

*STATE*: which US state the incident occurred in
*INCIDENT TYPE*: (Cooking fire, chimney fire, portable building fire,
  outside fire, etc)
*AID*: whether help was received from other fire departments
*HOUR OF DAY*: What time of day the fire occurred
*CONTROLLED TIME*: how long it took the fire department to control the fire
*CLEAR TIME*: Time elapsed from arrival to departure of fire protection
units
*SUPPRESSION_APPARATUS*: How many fire trucks were sent
*SUPPRESSION_PERSONNEL*: How many firefighters were dispatched
*PROPERTY VALUE*: the initial value of the property on which the fire occurred
*DETECTOR ALERT*: was there a fire detector, did it alarm, did it alert the occupants
*HAZMAT RELEASE*: what (if any) hazardous or flammable materials were
released in the incident (Propane, paint, etc)
*PROPERTY_USE*: Primary purpose a building is used for (Mall,
  Healthcare, Residential, etc)
*MIXED_USE*: OTHER purposes a building is used for
*NOT_RESIDENTIAL*: if true, building is not used for residential
*AREA_ORIGIN*: where did the fire start? (hallway, bedroom, storage)
*HEAT_SOURCE*: what started the fire?
(Sunlight, static discharge, fireworks, etc)
*IGNITION*: Basically was it intentional, an accident, or natural
*FIRE_SPREAD*: how far did the fire spread? (object of
  origin, room of origin, floor of origin, etc)
*STRUCTURE_TYPE*: Enclosed Building, Tent, Underground, etc
*STRUCTURE_STATUS*: Under construction, normal use, vacant
*SQUARE_FEET*: exactly what it sounds like
*AES_SYSTEM*: Automatic Extinguishing System

The next step I went through was outlier removal, because there
are a lot of values that skew quite heavily to the upper end and they have
so much variance, removing outliers entirely seems like the prudent approach
for this use case.  The incidents that had astronomically high property losses
were also obviously catastrophic incidents, and what we're trying to tackle
in this problem is revealing relative property loss predictions that might not
be immediately obvious to a human actor.  I used a normal distribution
analysis in a pandas dataframe and found the line where the top 10% of the
data set started ($60,000 in damage) and removed all data points with
target values above that from the dataset.  I also removed
data points where we had no incident type or where the incident
type was not a fire, since there are many data points
for medical or rescue incidents that don't result in property
damage at all and those aren't the incidents that we're
concerned about for the problem statement mentioned in the
use cases at the beginning of this report.

All the work mentioned above so far is done in the
"reduce_to_useful_inputs" script in the bin folder.  Throughout
the project I've tried to make sure each step is a distinct
function of the data generated in the step before so that I have
checkpoint artifacts of data written to storage along the
way after each transformation to play with (this helped
enormously in debugging).

In that same script, I also began batching up features
that were generating too many dimensions.  For example,
the "STATE" feature has 50 possible values.  Encoding
this as a 1-hot vector requires 50 dimensions, and the actual
variance it represents is quite tiered, not unique
per state.  So instead of having 50 categories, I reduced
this feature to 3 categories (those abnormally cheap states,
  those which were abnormally expensive, and the remainder). Many
features with a ton of potential options were grouped in similiar
ways based on observations in the FeatureExploration notebook
(for example, rather than having hours 0-24, we use 3 categories
  with similar target variable distribution: morning/evening,
  afternoon, and overnight).

The next step was to clean up the data.  There were several records
that had many missing values or huge outliers in given inputs.
To prevent them from affecting the input too dramatically, I took
a few different approaches.  For those input features with many values
missing, I replaced missing values with the median value for that
feature (controlled time, square feet, property value, clear time,
  suppression apparatus, suppression personnel).  For those same
  features, I'd just remove their data row from
the training set entirely if the row had a very large outlier.
This process reduced the dataset from about 215k candidate datapoints
to about 192k records, and was performed in the script "bin/clean_data".

More preprocessing was still necessary, however, because categorical
input dimensions were still represented by integers at this point and
continuous data inputs had quite variable scales (apparatus might be
anywhere from 2 to 100, but square feet might be 3000 to several
hundred thousand) which could have an inadvertan weighting impact on
how signficiantly each input is considered.  For categorical inputs,
I used 1-hot encoded vectors to make each possible category a binary
dimension on it's own.  For continuous inputs, I used the min/max of
their distribution to transform their values to a floating point
number between 0 and 1. This work was done in the script at
"bin/normalize_data".

At this point I had a dataset of only relevant records with
all the inputs cleaned and processed ready for training.  To make
sure I had a validation set left over of totally unseen data
to check the real error rate against, I reserved about 30,000 records
at this point by removing them from the dataset and writing
them to a different datastore (random selection).  This work
can be seen in the script at "bin/split_off_test_set".

The records ready for training were now available in the
sqlite file "data/training_incidents.sqlite".

- _If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?_
- _Based on the **Data Exploration** section, if there were abnormalities or characteristics that needed to be addressed, have they been properly corrected?_
- _If no preprocessing is needed, has it been made clear why?_

### Implementation
In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_
- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_
- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_

### Refinement
In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_
- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_
- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_


## IV. Results
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Model Evaluation and Validation
In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the modelâ€™s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_
- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_
- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_
- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_

### Justification
In this section, your modelâ€™s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_
- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_
- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_


## V. Conclusion
_(approx. 1-2 pages)_

### Free-Form Visualization
In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_
- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_
- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_

### Reflection
In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_
- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_
- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_
- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_

### Improvement
In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:
- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_
- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_
- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_
