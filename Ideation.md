## Ideas

* Cajone track generator
* IRL spam detection
* Beetle Damage Detection in aerial photos
* Suspicious Wikipedia Edits https://www.kaggle.com/c/wikichallenge/Data
* Go Player Identification
* http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ identify Paper Citation rings
* https://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8964 Use nutrition data and information about things someone likes to determine what other things they will like that they haven't tried.
* should I build a railway station here (accident data)? http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/officeofsafety/default.aspx
* clustering within power usage data: http://redd.csail.mit.edu/
* Global Attitudes and Trends from Pew: http://www.pewglobal.org/category/datasets/
* something something wildfires: http://wildfire.cr.usgs.gov/firehistory/data.html
* is this tree dead? photo classifier for plant pathology
* NFIRS loss estimate regression (http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-2126-31471-8394/nfirs_2011_120612.zip)
* Q-learning airplane landing agent with broadcast data from other agents
* Audio voice sample mood classification
* poll datapoints up to presidential election party prediction
* twitter sarcasm detection
* bird call classifier (audio data)
* frog call classifier

_now disqualify some for various reasons_

### Too Long for this project to generate my own data

* Cajone track generator
* IRL spam detection

### Done recently in a kaggle project or similar

* bird call classifier (audio data)
* Suspicious Wikipedia Edits https://www.kaggle.com/c/wikichallenge/Data
* twitter sarcasm detection
* poll datapoints up to presidential election party prediction

### Can't find useful dataset

* is this tree dead? photo classifier for plant pathology
* Audio voice sample mood classification

### Insufficient domain experience

* Q-learning airplane landing agent with broadcast data from other agents
* frog call classifier
* something something wildfires: http://wildfire.cr.usgs.gov/firehistory/data.html
* http://snap.stanford.edu/data/ identify Paper Citation rings
* https://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8964 Use nutrition data and information about things someone likes to determine what other things they will like that they haven't tried.

### Unsure about feature extraction

* Go Player Identification
* should I build a railway station here (accident data)? http://safetydata.fra.dot.gov/officeofsafety/default.asp

## Remaining Options

* clustering within power usage data: http://redd.csail.mit.edu/
* Global Attitudes and Trends from Pew: http://www.pewglobal.org
* NFIRS loss estimate regression (http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-2126-31471-8394/nfirs_2011_120612.zip)


# Conclusion

Of the remaining items, as a firefighter in a past career the NFIRS data is particularly
fascinating to me, and I have sufficient domain experience in firefighting
to have data insights that would be non-obvious to someone new to the field.
